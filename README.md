# Cloud-Lab-Codebase
This repository provides documentation, example code, and suggestions for Emerald Cloud Lab users. Emerald Cloud Lab is a platform for running molecular biology workflows such as sequencing, PCR, and cloning entirely from your computer. The user specifies their experimental protocol in a Wolfram Language programming environment, and on-site technicians handle the rest using automated lab equipment.
